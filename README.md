# EyeTracker
## Software Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. User Authentication and Permission: the system must ask the user for permission to use webcam for eye-tracking. Should include a consent form, and user agreement. 
2. Collect Eye-Tracking Data: the software will capture real time eye movement data using the webcam. Should be able to detect when the user is no longer looking at the screen. 
3. Data Pre-processing and Mining: system must analyze the collected data to identify patterns in user behavior. 
4. Data Analysis: Provide real time feedback or insights based on the analysis. 
5. Data Storage and Privacy: the system should securely store user data locally or on a cloud service. It should ensure privacy of user data and prevent vulnerabilities of data leak. 
6. Optimization for system performance: should implement smart algorithms to optimize the software. Ensure it supports multi platforms. 
### Non -Functional Requirements:
1. Usability: System should have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. 
2. Reliability: system should be robust, with minimal crashes or data loss incidents.
3. Security: ensure data transmissions are encrypted, specially if transferred to the cloud.
